# A Probabilistic Logic Agent Framework for Context-Aware Reasoning and Parallel Scenario Modeling

## Abstract

This paper introduces the **Probabilistic Logic Agent Framework**, a novel system that integrates symbolic reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and context-aware adjustments to model uncertainty in real-world scenarios. The framework supports dynamic context-aware reasoning, parallel scenario modeling across diverse domains, and hybrid reasoning for combining symbolic and probabilistic systems. We demonstrate its applicability in domains such as accounting, auditing, pharmaceutical, oncology, and logistics. The framework's modularity, explainability, and scalability make it a valuable tool for decision-making in uncertain environments.

## 1. Introduction

Reasoning under uncertainty is a critical challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional symbolic reasoning systems provide logical guarantees but lack the ability to handle uncertainty. Probabilistic reasoning systems, on the other hand, model uncertainty but often lack explainability. This paper presents a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both approaches while introducing **context-aware reasoning** and **parallel scenario modeling** to address real-world complexities.

### Contributions
1. **Context-Aware Reasoning**: Dynamically adjusts rule probabilities based on external conditions.
2. **Parallel Scenario Modeling**: Supports domain-specific scenario configurations for comparative analysis.
3. **Hybrid Reasoning**: Combines symbolic and probabilistic reasoning for comprehensive decision-making.
4. **Explainability**: Provides detailed reasoning chains for each query.
5. **Scalability**: Handles complex scenarios across multiple domains.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Symbolic Reasoning
Symbolic reasoning systems, such as Prolog and SAT solvers, provide logical guarantees but are limited in handling uncertainty. Model checking techniques have been widely used for verifying logical entailments.

### 2.2 Probabilistic Reasoning
Probabilistic reasoning systems, such as Bayesian networks, model uncertainty but often lack modularity and explainability. Forward chaining is a common approach for propagating probabilities.

### 2.3 Hybrid Reasoning
Hybrid reasoning systems attempt to combine symbolic and probabilistic reasoning. However, existing systems often lack support for dynamic context-aware adjustments and parallel scenario modeling.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Probabilistic Reasoning
The framework employs forward chaining to infer new facts and calculate their probabilities. The probability of a result is calculated as:
```
P(B) = Prule * min(P(A1), P(A2), ..., P(An))
```
where `Prule` is the rule's base probability, and `P(Ai)` are the probabilities of the antecedents.

### 3.2 Context-Aware Reasoning
Each rule can specify context variables with associated weights. The adjusted probability is computed as:
```
P_adjusted = P_rule * ∏(weight for each active context variable)
```
If the computed value exceeds 1.0, it is capped at 1.0.

### 3.3 Parallel Scenario Modeling
The framework supports domain-specific scenario configurations in JSON files. Each scenario includes facts, rules, and queries. Parallel scenarios allow comparative analysis across domains such as accounting, auditing, pharmaceutical, oncology, and logistics.

### 3.4 Hybrid Reasoning
The hybrid engine combines symbolic and probabilistic reasoning. Symbolic reasoning provides logical guarantees, while probabilistic reasoning handles uncertainty. The results are combined to provide a comprehensive explanation.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Framework Architecture
The framework consists of the following components:
1. **Knowledge Base (KB)**: Stores facts and rules for symbolic reasoning.
2. **Probabilistic KB**: Stores probabilistic rules and supports context-aware adjustments.
3. **Inference Engine**: Performs forward chaining to infer new facts and calculate probabilities.
4. **Hybrid Engine**: Combines symbolic and probabilistic reasoning.
5. **REST API**: Provides programmatic access to the framework.

### 4.2 JSON Configuration
Scenarios are defined in JSON files with the following structure:
```json
{
  "facts": ["Fact1", "Fact2"],
  "rules": [
    {
      "condition": ["Fact1", "Fact2"],
      "result": "ResultFact",
      "probability": 0.8,
      "context": {
        "ContextVariable1": 1.2,
        "ContextVariable2": 1.5
      }
    }
  ],
  "queries": ["ResultFact"]
}
```

### 4.3 REST API
The REST API supports the following endpoints:
1. **Load Scenario**: Dynamically load a JSON scenario.
2. **Query Knowledge Base**: Retrieve probabilities and explanations for specific queries.

## 5. Experimental Results

### 5.1 Benchmarking
We evaluated the framework's performance on complex scenarios across multiple domains. The benchmarking script measured query execution time and total execution time.

| Domain          | Scenario Complexity | Queries | Execution Time (s) |
|------------------|---------------------|---------|---------------------|
| Accounting       | Very Complex        | 3       | 0.45               |
| Auditing         | Complex             | 2       | 0.32               |
| Pharmaceutical   | Very Complex        | 3       | 0.50               |
| Oncology         | Complex             | 2       | 0.40               |
| Logistics        | Very Complex        | 1       | 0.28               |

### 5.2 Case Studies
#### Case Study 1: Fraud Detection in Accounting
- **Scenario**: Detect fraud based on transaction patterns.
- **Result**: The framework identified a fraud risk with a probability of 0.85 and recommended an audit.

#### Case Study 2: Oncology Treatment Planning
- **Scenario**: Infer treatment plans based on patient data.
- **Result**: The framework recommended a comprehensive treatment plan with a probability of 0.9.
