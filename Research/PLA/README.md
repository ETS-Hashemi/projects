# Probabilistic Logic Agent Framework

## Overview

The **Probabilistic Logic Agent Framework** is a Python-based system that integrates **symbolic propositional logic** with **probabilistic reasoning**. It enables reasoning in **uncertain environments** using **weighted logical rules** to infer probabilistic outcomes. Designed for **explainability** and **modularity**, this framework is ideal for domains like auditing, legal reasoning, medical AI, and decision support systems.

---

## Motivation

Real-world decisions often involve uncertainty, such as:
> "If A and B, then probably C."

Existing AI systems force a choice between:
- **Symbolic logic**: Explainable but rigid and not uncertainty-aware.
- **Probabilistic models**: Flexible but opaque and not rule-driven.

This framework bridges the gap by combining **rules with probabilities**, enabling agents to answer **what they believe**, **how confident they are**, and **why**.

## What Makes This Different?

| **Feature**       | **This Project**                     | **CS50AI Logic Agents** | **Markov Logic Networks (MLNs)** | **Bayesian Networks** | **Black-Box AI / ML** |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Logic Type**     | **Propositional logic + probabilities** | Propositional only      | First-order logic                | None                   | None                   |
| **Explainability** | ✅ Full reasoning trace             | ✅                       | ❌ (sampling-based)               | ❌ (graph traversal)    | ❌                     |
| **Language**       | **Pure Python**                     | Python                  | Prolog / Alchemy / Java           | Python (pgmpy)         | Python                 |
| **Inference**      | **Model checking + probabilistic scoring** | Model checking         | MRF sampling                     | Variable elimination   | Gradient descent       |
| **Data Requirement** | ✅ Works with few rules            | ✅                       | ❌ Needs grounding                | ❌ Graphs must be trained | ❌ Requires large data |
| **Modifiability**  | ✅ Simple rule editing              | ✅                       | ❌ Complex template structure     | ❌ Inflexible           | ❌                     |
| **Use Case**       | Decision support, explainable AI    | Learning logic          | Large knowledge graphs            | Probabilistic causality | Pattern recognition    |

✅ **This is not an MLN, not a BN, and not just CS50AI with tweaks.**  
It is a new, hybrid symbolic-probabilistic framework for **explainable inference in uncertain environments.**

## Features

- Define rules like `"If A and B → C (0.9)"`.
- Add facts to a knowledge base and query for probabilities.
- Trace all rule activations and logic chains for full explainability.
- Lightweight, modular architecture with no heavy dependencies.
- Works in low-data environments and supports easy rule editing.

## Example Usage

```python
from prob_agent import ProbSymbol, ProbRule, ProbKB, InferenceEngine

# Define symbols
large = ProbSymbol("LargeTransaction")
no_receipt = ProbSymbol("NoReceipt")
fraud = ProbSymbol("Fraud")

# Define a probabilistic rule
rule1 = ProbRule(
    condition=[large, no_receipt],
    result=fraud,
    probability=0.85
)

# Set up the knowledge base
kb = ProbKB()
kb.add_fact(large)
kb.add_fact(no_receipt)
kb.add_rule(rule1)

# Query the KB
engine = InferenceEngine(kb)
prob, explanation = engine.query(fraud)

print(f"P(Fraud) = {prob}")
print("Explanation:")
print(explanation)
```

---

## Applications

- **Auditing & Accounting**: Fraud detection using rules like "Large transaction + no receipt = suspicious."
- **Legal Reasoning**: Evaluate liability or guilt from structured case facts.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Diagnose based on symptoms with known probabilities.
- **Educational AI**: Infer student understanding from indirect indicators.
- **AI Governance**: Rule-aware, safe agents for decision support.
