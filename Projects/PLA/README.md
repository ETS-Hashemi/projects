# 🧠 Probabilistic Logic Agent Framework

## Overview

This project implements a novel Python-based **Probabilistic Logic Agent Framework**, which integrates symbolic propositional logic with probabilistic reasoning. Unlike classical knowledge-based agents (e.g., in CS50AI) that operate in strictly true/false logic, this agent can reason about **uncertain environments**, using **weighted logical rules** to infer probabilistic outcomes.

The system is **fully explainable**, **modular**, and designed to work in **low-data, high-transparency domains** like auditing, legal reasoning, medical AI, and decision support systems.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Real-world decisions aren't binary. In domains like finance, law, or healthcare, we often say:

> "If A and B, then probably C."

But most AI systems force us to choose between:
- **Symbolic logic**: explainable, but rigid and not uncertainty-aware
- **Probabilistic models**: flexible, but opaque and not rule-driven

This project bridges that gap by creating a framework where **rules can have probabilities**, and the agent can answer not only **what** it believes but **how confident it is and why**.

## 🧬 What Makes This Different?

| Feature | This Project | CS50AI Logic Agents | Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) | Bayesian Networks | Black-Box AI / ML |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Logic Type | **Propositional logic + probabilities** | Propositional only | First-order logic | None | None |
| Explainability | ✅ Full reasoning trace | ✅ | ❌ (sampling-based) | ❌ (graph traversal) | ❌ |
| Language | **Pure Python** | Python | Prolog / Alchemy / Java | Python (pgmpy) | Python |
| Inference | **Model checking + probabilistic scoring** | Model checking | MRF sampling | Variable elimination | Gradient descent |
| Data Requirement | ✅ Works with few rules | ✅ | ❌ Needs grounding | ❌ Graphs must be trained | ❌ Requires large data |
| Modifiability | ✅ Simple rule editing | ✅ | ❌ Complex template structure | ❌ Inflexible | ❌ |
| Use Case | Decision support, explainable AI | Learning logic | Large knowledge graphs | Probabilistic causality | Pattern recognition |

✅ **This is not an MLN, not a BN, and not just CS50AI with tweaks.**  
It is a new, hybrid symbolic-probabilistic framework for **explainable inference in uncertain environments.**

## 🚀 Features

- Define rules like `"If A and B → C (0.9)"`
- Add facts to a knowledge base
- Query the system for `P(Query | KB)`
- Trace all rule activations and logic chains
- Lightweight, modular architecture (no huge frameworks)
- Easy to extend with different inference backends
- Works even in low-data environments

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/probabilistic-logic-agent.git
cd probabilistic-logic-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠 Example Usage

```python
from prob_agent import ProbSymbol, ProbRule, ProbKB, InferenceEngine

# Define symbols
large = ProbSymbol("LargeTransaction")
no_receipt = ProbSymbol("NoReceipt")
fraud = ProbSymbol("Fraud")

# Define a probabilistic rule
rule1 = ProbRule(
    condition=[large, no_receipt],
    result=fraud,
    probability=0.85
)

# Set up the knowledge base
kb = ProbKB()
kb.add_fact(large)
kb.add_fact(no_receipt)
kb.add_rule(rule1)

# Query the KB
engine = InferenceEngine(kb)
prob, explanation = engine.query(fraud)

print(f"P(Fraud) = {prob}")
print("Explanation:")
print(explanation)
```

---

## 🔍 Applications

- 🧾 **Auditing & Accounting**: Fraud detection using rules like "Large transaction + no receipt = suspicious"
- ⚖️ **Legal Reasoning**: Evaluate guilt or liability from structured case facts
- 🩺 **Medical Diagnosis**: Diagnose based on symptoms with known probabilities
- 🎓 **Educational AI**: Reason about student understanding from indirect indicators
- 🤖 **AI Governance**: Rule-aware, safe agents for decision support

## 🧠 Why Build This?

- Symbolic AI is explainable, but not flexible  
- Statistical AI is powerful, but not understandable  
- Probabilistic logic agents bring **the best of both worlds**  
- No usable, open-source, educational hybrid exists — until now
